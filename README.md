In this dataset, brought from Kaggle, I used hypothesis tests, by normalizing the data between two samples,
also made an equity verification between the two samples and dependency test also between them.
From there, I separated the dataset into two different blocks. (70% for analysis and 30% for validation), then,
after that I extracted, from the analysis block, three random samples of 30% of its 70% and tested statistical hypotesis
and plotted some graphs to visualize the behavior.
